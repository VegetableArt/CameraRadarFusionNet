# CRF-Net for Object Detection
This repository provides a neural network for object detection based on camera and radar data. It builds up on the work of [Keras RetinaNet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet). 
The network performs a multi-level fusion of the radar and camera data within the neural network.
The network can be tested on the [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/) dataset, which provides camera and radar data along with 3D ground truth information.

## Requirements
- Linux Ubuntu (18.04)
- Supported GPU: [CUDA GPUs | NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
- CUDA 10.0
- Python 3.5

## Installation
For the installation instructions check out [this website](https://vegetableart.github.io/CameraRadarFusionNet/).
