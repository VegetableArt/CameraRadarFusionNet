# Reproduction project

## 1. Introduction

This project is about paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07431/" target="_blank">[1]</a> which was published in May 2020. Based on this paper a reproduction has to be done for the course CS4240. The paper provides a link to the GitHub repository containing the code they used to produce the project <a href="https://github.com/TUMFTM/CameraRadarFusionNet/" target="_blank">[2]</a>. The aim of this project to describe how this project can be reproduced. First by trying the provided GitHub code and its instructions and then with adjustments to the code and process to get it working. Due to the hard nature of getting this repository to work (depending on the situation) the main goal of this project will be to describe what aspects are important to keep in mind when sharing code that is used to write a paper about deep learning and what errors can be encountered when trying to reproduce certain code given by an author of a deep learning paper. Also some guidelines will be given to prevent situations where it's almost impossible to reproduce code while given clear instructions.
